# Implementation of Ricart-Argawala

**Description:**

You are required to implement distributed mutual exclusion among nodes
in a distributed system. Your implementation must use the
Ricart-Argawala algorithm discussed during the lectures.

**System Requirements:**

- R1 (Spec): Implement a system with a set of nodes and a Critical Section that represents a sensitive system operation. Any node may request access to the Critical Section at any time. In this exercise, the Critical Section can be emulated, for example, by a print statement or writing to a shared database on the network.
- R2 (Safety): Only one node may enter the Critical Section at any time.
- R3 (Liveliness): Every node that requests access to the Critical Section will eventually gain access.


**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement the service's nodes using Golang.
- Provide a README.md file in your source code repository that explains how to start your system.
- Use gRPC for message passing between nodes (hint: each node is both a grpc server and a client to every other node).
- Demonstrate that the system can start with at least three nodes.
- Show, using system logs, a sequence of messages that leads to a node gaining access to the Critical Section.
- Implement some sort of service discovery so that nodes can locate each other. Options to consider include:
    - hardcoding in each node (easy)
    - Supplying a file with IP addresses and ports of other nodes
    - Entering IP addresses and ports via the command line
    - Using an existing package or service for discovery


**Hand-in Requirements:**
- Submit a single report as a PDF file (maximum 2 pages)
- Describe how your system meets the System Requirements (R1, R2, and R3)
- Provide a discussion of your algorithm, using examples from your logs (as per Technical Requirement 5)
- Include a link to a Git repository with your source code in the report
- Append system logs in the report's appendix to demonstrate that the requirements are met
